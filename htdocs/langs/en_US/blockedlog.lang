BlockedLog=Unalterable Logs
BlockedLogDesc=This module tracks some events into an unalterable log (that you can't modify once recorded) into a block chain, in real time. This module provides features for compatibility with legal requirements of some countries (Spain, France - Loi Finance, ...).
Fingerprints=Archived events and fingerprints
FingerprintsDesc=This is the tool to browse or extract the unalterable logs. Unalterable logs are generated and store into a dedicated table of the systel, in real time when a business event appears.
ArchivesDesc=You can use this tool to export Unalterable Logs into archive files. They are kept into the system but you should download and copy them into external supports.
UnalterableLogTool1=The law of some countries (like in France when doing B2C), ask that you do it on a regular basis.
UnalterableLogTool1FR=In France, you MUST generate archives of the unalterable logs, at least, once every year. We recommand to do it once per month. Also, you MUST keep these archives for at least 7 years. According to the law, It is the user's responsibility to store their archives on media that guarantee their preservation, including in the event of hardware failure, so we recommand to store them on at least 2 different physical supports.
UnalterableLogTool2=This unalterable Logs contains the history of unalterable data. It is the responsibility of the application user to ensure system backups, in order to comply with legal obligations. If you decide to secure your unalterable logs by exporting and storing archives files instead of a full database backup (tab <b>%s</b>), it is recommended to store the exported archive files in different places (Secured cloud, External USB drive, ...).
UnalterableLogTool3=Note that, there is no feature to purge this log and every change tried to be done directly into this log (by a hacker for example) will be reported with a non-valid fingerprint.
FingerprintsDesc2=If you really need to purge this table because you used your application for a demo/test purpose and want to clean your data to start your production, you can ask your reseller or integrator to reset your database (all your data will be removed).
CompanyInitialKey=Company initial key (hash of genesis block)

DownloadBlockChain=Download fingerprints
KoCheckFingerprintValidity=Archived log entry is not valid. It means someone (a hacker?) has modified some data of this record after it was recorded, OR has erased the previous archived record (check that the line with previous # exists) OR has modified the checksum of the previous record.
OkCheckFingerprintValidity=Archived log record is valid. The data on this line was not modified and the entry follows the previous one.
OkCheckFingerprintValidityButChainIsKo=Archived log seems valid compared to previous one but the chain was corrupted previously.

DataOfArchivedEventHelp2=The integrity of data on each line is guaranteed if the status of the line is OK
ImpossibleToReloadObject=Original object (type %s, id %s) not linked (see 'Full datas' column to get unalterable saved data)
BlockedLogAreRequiredByYourCountryLegislation=Unalterable Logs module may be required by the legislation of your country. Disabling this module may render any future transactions invalid with respect to the law and the use of legal software as they can not be validated by a tax audit.

Disabling this module may render any future transactions invalid with respect to the law and the use of legal software as they cannot be validated by a tax audit.
BlockedLogDisableNotAllowedForCountry=List of countries where usage of this module is mandatory (just to prevent to disable the module by error, if your country is in this list, disable of module is not possible without editing this list first. Note also that enabling/disabling this module will keep a track into the unalterable log).
OnlyNonValid=Non-valid
